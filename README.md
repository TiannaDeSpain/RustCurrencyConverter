# Overview

This program is written to convert monetary value between US Dollars, Pesos and Euros and Yen. The user inputs what the money is originally, what currency they would like to convert to and then enter the amount. The software then calculates and outputs the value in the new currency.

I wrote this sofware as my first ever Rust project, in hopes to gain a better understanding of Rust and its abilities.

* Add currency symbols to output
* Use API pull for currency exchange rate information.
